Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**custom_fields** | **string[]** | Record custom field values used as filters. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon).  For example, &#x60;customFields&#x3D;field1:value1,field2:value2&#x60;. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields&#x3D;field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, &#x60;customFields&#x3D;tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31&#x60; would match results whose custom field with internal name &#x60;tradeType&#x60; is either &#x60;offer&#x60; or &#x60;search&#x60;, and whose &#x60;extraDate&#x60; is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like &#x60;customFields&#x3D;extraDate:|2001-12-31&#x60;. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: &#x60;customFields&#x3D;dynamic:a|b|c&#x60;. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: &#x60;customFields&#x3D;dynamic:&#x27;business&#x60;. | [optional] 
**creation_period** | [**\DateTime[]**](\DateTime.md) | The minimum / maximum record creation date | [optional] 
**created_by** | **string** | Either the id or identifier of the user that created the record | [optional]
